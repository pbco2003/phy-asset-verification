# Automated Physical Asset Verification using BLE

This repository contains the hardware setup details and source code for an automated asset verification system based on the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy)

## OVERVIEW

This project uses Mediatek Linkit ONE board as a BLE gateway and Cypress 4.1 BLE / Beacon device as the BLE node. The application server is hosted on Thingsboard and enables users to track their physical assets attached with the BLE node. The LinkIt-One board acts as the BLE gateway that aggregates all beacon signals from the BLE nodes. It detects the presence or absense of assets in a specified area and updates this information on a dashboard hosted by the Thingsboard server.
